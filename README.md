# AtlasVTT

A game system agnostic virtual tabletop for tabletop RPGs that runs inside [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). 

I built Atlas as part of my bachelor's thesis to give the TTRPG community a virtual tabletop that's open source, hackable, and free to use. Every file Atlas creates, every token, every map, every world you build, stays yours and stays local. It follows the same philosophy as Obsidian: your work lives on your machine, in formats you control, with no account and no server in between.

TTRPG worlds in my opinion are something very personal and players and DMs get attached to them. That attachment deserves better than a subscription and someone else's database. Atlas makes sure your creative output stays yours, just like a sheet of paper would.

Ease of use matters just as much to me. Atlas aims for a minimal, streamlined interface that feels native to Obsidian, with clear controls and simple workflows that keep your attention on the game.

AtlasVTT is desktop only for now

## At the table

- **Maps and grids:** Build scenes from your own map images. Align square or hex grids manually or with automatic detection.
- **Tokens and encounters:** Import characters, move and resize tokens, and save groups as reusable encounters. Link creature notes with the optional [Fantasy Statblocks](https://github.com/javalent/fantasy-statblocks) plugin. Simple die syntax like 2d8+2 will be turned into a clickable dice roll.
- **Fog and player view:** Reveal the map as your players explore. Show a separate player window on a second screen while keeping GM information hidden.
- **Drawing and notes:** Sketch, add text, measure distances, and pin Markdown notes or other Atlas maps to locations.
- **Dice and initiative:** Roll dice, review the roll log, track turns, and keep counters and timers close at hand.
- **Music and controls:** Play audio from your vault, customise map hotkeys, and undo or redo map edits.

## Your notes, right on the map

Pin an Obsidian markdown note or even another Atlas map to a location, then read and edit it in a floating panel without leaving the map. Keep room descriptions, session prep, and character details close at hand, with Obsidian's familiar note linking built in.

## Organise your campaign

Keep scenes, maps, encounters, and characters together in collections. Use folders and tags to find what you need, then bring it onto the map.

## Install

Requires **Obsidian 1.8.7 or newer on desktop**. Atlas VTT is available through Obsidian's community plugins.

1. Open **Settings → Community plugins** and turn off **Restricted mode** if it is enabled.
2. Select **Browse** and search for **Atlas VTT**.
3. Select **Install**, then **Enable**.

Check for updates under **Settings → Community plugins**.

Want to try upcoming features early? Beta builds are available through BRAT, see [docs/beta-testing.md](docs/beta-testing.md).

<details>
<summary>Manual installation</summary>

Download `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and `styles.css` from a [GitHub release](https://github.com/ByteMirror/atlas-vtt/releases). Place them in `<your vault>/.obsidian/plugins/atlas-vtt/`, then enable Atlas VTT under **Settings → Community plugins**.

</details>

## Your first scene

1. Run **Atlas VTT: Open dashboard** from the command palette.
2. Use the **+** button in the asset manager to import a map image, then create a scene using that map.
3. Align the grid with automatic detection or the manual alignment tool.
4. Import tokens and place them on your scene.
5. For a local game, open the player view and move it to your second screen.

## Privacy and network use

Atlas works offline with files in your vault. It has no accounts, telemetry, or ads. Scenes are saved as `.atlasmap` files, and the rest of your library (tokens, encounters, collection settings, game system presets) as JSON files in the `atlas-vtt` folder, so it syncs with your vault. With Obsidian Sync, turn on "Sync all other types".

If you use an external image URL for a token or map background, or copy an externally hosted image from a note, Atlas downloads that image from the supplied address. Vault images require no network access. When you explicitly submit an issue report, Atlas sends it to `https://srv1871379.hstgr.cloud/atlas/reports`, which creates a public GitHub issue. See [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md) for details.

## Help and contributing

Found a bug or have an idea? Run the **Report an issue** command inside Obsidian or use **Settings → Atlas VTT → Help and feedback**. Atlas fills in your versions and submits your report directly, without a GitHub account or a second form; see [docs/reporting-issues.md](docs/reporting-issues.md). To contribute code, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

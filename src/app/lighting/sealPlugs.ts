 * `reach` of it (the tolerance, and the hair a bridge lands past its wall). Every ray those bridges would stop
 * comes from outside the polygon and crosses one of them inside it, so the polygon stops it
 * too. Ends in one square of `PLUG_CELL` share a polygon, around the square's middle and wider
 * by the square's half diagonal, so a heap of such ends costs a handful of bridges. A polygon
 * reaches a little past the tolerance at its corners (0.45 px from an end at a tolerance of 13),
 * where it closes more than a bridge for every pair would; the octagon it replaces reached
 * 1.1 px past it. It cannot stay within the tolerance and hold every landing: those lie up to
 * the tolerance away on every side, and it is the landings it must not let a ray pass between.

 * Lights and walls as lighting and sight read them. A map file arrives unchecked (a hand edit,
 * a sync conflict, a newer Atlas, another program) and the store keeps what it holds, so that
 * the next save writes it back: what cannot be read is passed over here, at reading, and
 * nothing is removed from the file. An object that is no light or wall at all (no place, no
 * radius) reads as none; a field of the wrong type reads as unset.
 *
 * An object with nothing wrong is read as itself, and one that needed mending as the same view
 * every time, so whoever compares lights or walls finds unchanged ones unchanged.

/**
 * The dice renderer: **real light instead of computed tones.**
 *
 * A software version painted every face with a gradient and a formula
 * highlight; it read as cardboard, not as a die. What gives a die its look
 * cannot be painted per face:
 *
 * 1. **Reflections of the surroundings.** A studio environment
 *    (`RoomEnvironment`) stands behind the material as its mirror world.
 * 2. **The chamfer as a body.** The edge is really ground off: a narrow strip
 *    of geometry that catches the light differently from the face, anew at
 *    every turn (`dieMesh.ts`).
 * 3. **The cut numeral.** A bump map sinks the number into the material.
 * 4. **A real cast shadow.** The die casts it on the table, with a soft edge,
 *    in its own shape; no blob underneath.
 *
 * The math stays where it is: `dieGeometry.ts` supplies the bodies,
 * `dieMotion.ts` the path. This file only draws, through the document's one
 * WebGL context (`DiceGpu`), onto the stage's own canvas.

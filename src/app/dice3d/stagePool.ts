/**
 * **The pool of stages: why the app survives many throws.**
 *
 * One WebGL context per throw sounds clean and was the most expensive line of
 * the whole application: the browser keeps only a handful at once, and a
 * returned one keeps counting until garbage collection collects it (the
 * measurement is noted at `DiceRenderer.reset`). On a phone the system reloads
 * the page under memory pressure instead of warning.
 *
 * So a document has **one** context (`DiceGpu`), made with its first stage,
 * and stages are borrowed, not built. A stage that leaves clears itself and
 * goes back into the pool; the next one takes it, canvas and all. The pool
 * therefore never grows beyond the number of stages that were ever on screen
 * at the same time (plus those fading out).
 *
 * **And it lives in its own module, not with the stage component**, so a hot
 * reload of the component does not drop it and pile up exactly the contexts
 * this is about. What the module holds is given back when Atlas unloads
 * (`releaseStagePools`) and when a window closes (`releaseStagePool`): a
 * context nobody gives back outlives the plugin that made it.
 *
 * Atlas can show dice in the main window and in a pop-out window. A canvas and
 * its context belong to one document, so there is one pool per document.

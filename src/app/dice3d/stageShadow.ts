 * hundred million reads a frame: nine tenths of a dice frame's time on the
 * graphics card, the same for one die as for ten, on a display that asks for
 * 120 frames a second and has a lit map to draw as well.
 *
 * The panel shows about five units of table on some 670 pixels, and the map
 * spans eight: 1024 texels still put more than one on every pixel. The blur
 * above is counted in texels, so half the map takes half the radius for the
 * same softness on the table, and half the taps keep their spacing.

 * Two values change with it:
 *
 * - **The colour** goes to black instead of ink. Ink on a dark page barely
 *   differs from the page: a shadow you would have to measure to find.
 * - **The opacity** rises, because the way down is shorter. Even black at one
 *   and a half times the opacity takes less from the dark page than the light
 *   case takes from the light one; more would be a hole in the paper.

 * **Where the key light stands.**

 * It once hung almost straight above the table, so the shadow would lie
 * *under* the die rather than beside it. That was true, and it was why none of
 * it could be seen: at 75° elevation it vanished entirely under the body that
 * casts it. A shadow hidden by its own body is no shadow.
 *
 * Now it stands at a good 60°: flat enough that the silhouette falls on the
 * table beside the die and its shape can be read, steep enough that it clings
 * to the body instead of running across the sheet.
 *
 * **And it stands back left, not front left.** The camera looks at the table
 * from above and in front; on screen, depth (-z) is *up*. A light from the
 * front threw the shadow **up**, behind the die, but a view from above calls for
 * a shadow falling down. So the light moves over the die to the other side:
 * from back left, shadow to front right, lower right on screen.
 *
 * The fill light pays back what that costs: the faces turned to the viewer
 * only get grazing light from the key, and without light from the front they
 * would be too dark for their numerals.

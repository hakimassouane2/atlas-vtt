 *
 * The teeth sit on the die's own easing curve, not on one of their own. The
 * die spins by `1 - (1 - s)^ease`; a wheel clicks once per tooth, once per
 * equal share of rotation. Solved for time, that says when the k-th tooth
 * passes, so the wheel slows exactly when the die does. An invented spread
 * used to run beside the picture instead.
 *
 * Each tooth is two voices at the same instant: the dull strike below, a
 * brighter, shorter one above. The dull one alone sounded heard through a door;
 * a click's bite sits up high. Layered, not replaced: the wood gets an edge.
 *
 * Scheduled ahead, not ticked: `setInterval` runs on the frame clock and wobbles
 * with load, the audio clock does not. An audibly wobbling wheel is worse than
 * none.

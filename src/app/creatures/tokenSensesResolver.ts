/**
 * The seam between linked statblocks and sight: one object a lighting view asks how each token
 * perceives, and that tells it when the answer may have changed.
 *
 *     const senses = tokenSensesResolver(CreatureIndex.forApp(app), mapSenseRulesSource(app, assetService, () => store.getState()));
 *     const stop = senses.subscribe(() => rebuildSight());   // on destroy: stop()
 *     // while building sight sources, for every vision token:
 *     const { senses: list, sightRange, pending, key } = senses.visionOf(token);
 *
 * What sight does with it:
 * - `senses` are the token's senses (`resolveSenses` gives their definitions and reach).
 * - `sightRange` is how far its normal sight reaches, in game units: unset is unlimited, 0 is no
 *   normal sight at all. It already holds the token's own `vision.range` where set, and else the
 *   radius its statblock says the creature is blind beyond; use it in place of `vision.range`.
 * - `pending`: the statblock is still being read and may change either; show and record nothing
 *   for the token until the announcement that follows.
 * - `key` changes exactly when one of the three does, for caches that compare sources.
 *
 * `subscribe` announces a statblock asked about that was read or changed (`CreatureIndex` is the
 * store React reads through `useCreatureIndex`; this is the same subscription outside React) and
 * a change of the collection's senses or of what it measures in.

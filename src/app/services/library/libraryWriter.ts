 * - a record Atlas worked out by itself and the user never changed stays unwritten;
 * - a file that vanished since it was last seen is left to the vault check, which
 *   decides whether it was deleted or moved elsewhere; it is never written back;
 * - a record whose file moved (its collection changed) is renamed, so sync tools see a move;
 * - files of records that left the index are trashed.
 * A file that fails is tried again on the next save; the others are still
 * written, and the failure is reported once all were tried.

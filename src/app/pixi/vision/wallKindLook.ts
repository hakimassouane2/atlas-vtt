/**
 * How the wall editor draws a wall that is not a plain wall. A wall for both is a plain line;
 * one for sight only is long dashes, one for light only dashes and dots in turn; a limited wall
 * is a row of dots, in the groups of its dashes where it blocks one thing only (threes for
 * sight, a pair and a single dot for light). The lengths are screen pixels, so the look reads
 * the same at any zoom, and each stroke lies on a dark casing, so it shows on a pale map as on
 * a dark one. A secret door of a kind keeps the secret door's colour and is drawn hollow, a
 * dark line down the middle of its strokes and a dark middle in its dots: a plain secret door
 * is a dashed line, which the kind's own pattern would hide.

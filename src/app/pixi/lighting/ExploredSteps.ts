 * forth on the memory's texture (`travelledCoverage`: only the texels a step changed, and never
 * taking away what the party has really seen since).

 * To know that, it keeps a second texture of the memory's size while it holds steps: whatever
 * sight records is stamped there too, at the serial of the newest edit, so a texel reads "last
 * seen while edit n was the newest". It exists only between the first sight record after an

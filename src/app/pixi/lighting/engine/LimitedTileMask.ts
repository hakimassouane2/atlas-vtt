/**
 * Takes out of a light's tile what limited walls stop. A sphere trace cannot count the walls it
 * crosses, so the tile is traced through solid walls only, and then:
 *
 * 1. Everything beyond the polygon of `sweepLightMask` is written as 0: along every ray from
 *    the light's place the tile is kept as far as the first limited wall, and behind that wall
 *    only as far as the rule's own reach (`computeVisibility`: the first solid wall or the
 *    second limited one). So before the first limited wall a light is what it is in any scene,
 *    with the soft shadows of solid walls, and behind one it is the rule's reach and nothing
 *    else: a soft shadow there would be light from the flame's edge that passed a solid wall's
 *    end through limited walls the count from the flame's middle never met. For every edge of
 *    the polygon the strip between the two rays from that edge outward is drawn, which together
 *    are all that lies outside it, the polygon being star-shaped (`beyond`). Around every edge
 *    that lies on a limited wall, a box a capsule's width to every side is written as 0 too:
 *    the wall's capsule, as a tile is dark inside a solid wall's.
 * 2. Around every limited wall, as far, each texel takes the darkest of itself and what lies
 *    across the wall (`limitedFragment`): a ray that runs along a wall and stops elsewhere
 *    lights the floor beside it though the wall's other side is dark, and no edge of the
 *    polygon lies there. Where the light passed the wall, both sides are lit and nothing changes.
 *
 * With both, no texel within a bilinear read of a limited wall's dark side is lit, whichever
 * way the light came to it, and the composite gives the wall's near face the light of the
 * floor in front of it, as it does for every wall.
 *
 * A light that no limited wall can stop keeps its tile as it is.

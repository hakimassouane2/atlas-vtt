 *   (a one-way wall joins a light's own field where it blocks from the light's side; a limited
 *   wall is in no tile's field: `LimitedTileMask`);
 * - `light()`: every wall that blocks light, one-way and limited ones too, which bounce and
 *   the composite's wall faces treat as solid and as blocking both ways;
 * - `zones()`: the same without the limited walls, which an ambient zone ends at;
 * - `sight()`: every wall that blocks sight, limited ones too, which the explored memory's blur
 *   must not cross.
 *
 * A scene whose walls all block both and both ways has one field, read under all three names;
 * the second exists while there is a one-way or a limited wall and the third while a wall
 * blocks one thing only. `trim` frees those the scene's walls no longer need, once the composite
 * has taken the fields that are left. A wall that blocks one thing is in the fields of that thing alone: to the other it is
 * no wall, in the leak guarantee of each field as anywhere else.

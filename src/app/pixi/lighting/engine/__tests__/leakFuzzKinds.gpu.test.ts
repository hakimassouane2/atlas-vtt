 * Walls that block one thing through the real engine, over the leak fuzz's rooms. A room's own
 * walls block light only (glass) or sight only (curtains), in turn, and the chains of walls that
 * cross it block the other thing, so a mix-up of the two shows in either.
 *
 * Glass: with everything seen, the room's lights light nothing past its walls, and a token
 * inside sees past them. Curtains: a token inside sees nothing past the walls (by sight, by
 * darkvision, as a footprint, as explored memory), and the lights shine past them. Each picture
 * is also held against the same scene with only the walls of its channel in it, as plain walls:
 * light with the walls that block light, sight and memory with those that block sight. And the
 * rule is asked at sampled points: where it counts light that passes every wall by a band or
 * more, the picture is lit; where it counts a point as seen or unseen, away from the edges of
 * sight and the soft edges of its shadows, the picture agrees.

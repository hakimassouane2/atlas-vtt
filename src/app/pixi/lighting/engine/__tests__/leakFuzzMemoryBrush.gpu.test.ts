/**
 * The GM's edits of the explored memory through `ExploredMemory` and the real engine, over the
 * leak fuzz's rooms, as the players see them with no one looking.
 *
 * A room revealed along its own walls (a lasso on their centre lines) shows inside the room and
 * never past its walls: the bound is the one the memory sight records is held to, one and a half
 * memory texels, or the wall's core where that is less. The same holds once everything was
 * forgotten and that step undone, which writes the room's texels back. Forgetting the same room
 * leaves nothing but a trace on the texels of its edge, which the reveal covered in part and the
 * eraser takes the same part of (undo is what takes an edit back exactly).
 *
 * A dab of the brush across a wall reveals both sides, since the GM decides what is explored;
 * it shows nowhere beyond its own radius and the blur the composite reads the memory through.

/**
 * Ambient zones and explored memory through the real engine, over the leak fuzz's rooms.
 *
 * Each room gets a zone of daylight in a pitch-black scene: a little smaller than the room, on
 * the room's own corners, or lying across its walls. With everything seen, a zone in its room
 * lights nothing past the walls, every zone is as bright as the day wherever the rule counts it
 * (off the walls themselves: a face takes the ambient light of the floor in front of it, and no
 * zone brighter than the scene lies on a wall), and nothing is lit beyond its soft edge. Then a
 * token with vision looks at the room from the dark outside (rooms without one-way walls, which
 * let sight in): it sees nothing lit at all, not a line on the wall.
 *
 * Each room is also remembered from within, recorded as the scene records it (`exploredShapes`
 * stamped into an `ExploredTexture`): with no one looking, the memory shows inside the room and
 * never past its walls. A memory texel on the centre line shows half on either side, so the
 * bound is one and a half memory texels, and on a large map, where that is more than a wall is
 * thick, the wall's core. The memory is then saved as the map file keeps it and drawn back as a
 * reopened scene draws it, which changes nothing, and once more from a mask of half its size, as
 * older versions saved it: the same bound holds.

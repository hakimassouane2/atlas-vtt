 * Limited walls through the real engine, over the leak fuzz's rooms. Every wall of a room is
 * limited, its outline (with its doors and one-way walls) and the chains across it, and a
 * second ring stands around the room, the outline again a third larger: limited walls for one
 * room, solid ones for the next (both ways, where the room's own block one way). The lights
 * and the tokens stand in the room; in every other room the lights are tokens' lights, and in
 * every third they were moved there.
 *
 * Nothing passes the ring: no light, no sight, no darkvision, no footprint, no memory, and no
 * darkness beyond the ring's core. That is the second limited wall on every way out (its
 * corners included, which the rays through them must not pass), or a solid wall behind a
 * limited one. Between the room's walls and the ring it is lit and seen: both passed the first
 * limited wall. And the rule is asked at sampled points: where it counts light that passes
 * every solid wall by a band, the picture is lit; where it counts a point as seen or unseen,
 * away from the edges of sight and the soft edges of its shadows, the picture agrees.

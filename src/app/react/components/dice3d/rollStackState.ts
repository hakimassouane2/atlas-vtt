/**
 * The stack of 3D rolls on screen. Rolls are not queued one after another: at
 * the table an attack and its damage are two rolls in the same motion. The
 * newest stands large at the bottom; older ones shrink to a row above it and
 * lay their dice down at once, since two rolls clattering together sound like
 * one noise.
 *
 * A panel leaves in two steps: `closeRoll` fades it out and `dismissRoll`
 * removes it once its fade time has passed. Removal hangs on a timer and never
 * on an animation reporting that it finished: rolling faster than a fade lasts
 * otherwise piled up panels, each with its own frame loop and WebGL context.
